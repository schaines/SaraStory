There was once a stressed out college student. They had a lot of exams and projects before spring break.

Every class seemed to pile more and more homework onto them, and almost every exam had a conflict with each other.
It was getting unbareable for them to keep functioning this way.
It almost seemed like too much until they discovered a reemdy for their problems.

Though it may sound strange, there was only one solution.
Albeit extreme, every student would not attend classes.
But what the teachers did in response was unbelievable...

Teachers decided to understand the students' perspective.
They used their wisdom and imparted it...
They reduced the workload but also, made the students realize that 
the assignments were good preparation for exam. :)
