There was once a stressed out college student. They had a lot of exams and projects before spring break.

Every class seemed to pile more and more homework onto them, and almost every exam had a conflict with each other.
It was getting unbareable for them to keep functioning this way.
It almost seemed like too much until they discovered a reemdy for their problems.
